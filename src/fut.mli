(** Future values for asynchronous programming.

    [Fut] provides support to define and combine futures.  A future is
    an undetermined value that becomes determined at an arbitrary
    point in the future. The future acts as a place-holder for the
    value while it is undetermined. 

    {{!promises}Promises} determine the value of futures cooperatively
    while {{!queues}future queues} determine the value of blocking or
    long running function applications with a set of concurrent
    workers and act as a mutual exclusion synchronization primitive.

    The separate {!Futu} library exposes {!Unix} system calls as
    futures. 

    Consult the {{!basics}basics}, the {{!semantics}semantics} 
    and {{!examples}examples}.

    recursively) are also aborted, except those that are protected
    by {!protect}. Aborting a future that is set has no effect since
    once the future is set it never changes again.

    a future queue, there's no guarantee that the corresponding application
    will be/has not been executed when it is set to [`Never]. In any

end

(** {1:basics Basics} 
    
    A future is a place-holder for a value that may become determined
    at an arbitrary point in the future. Futures can be combined
    together to define new futures that will determine whenever the
    underlying futures do. For example, below [revolt] determines once
    [time_to_revolt] does.
{[
let time_to_revolt = Fut.tick 1.871 in
let revolt = 
  Fut.bind time_to_revolt 
    (fun () -> Fut.apply Printf.printf "Revolt!")

let () = ignore (Fut.await revolt)   
]}
    A future can be in three different states described by the type 
    {!type:state} and returned by the (non-blocking) function {!Fut.state}. 
    It is:
    {ul 
    {- [`Undet], if the future is [`Undet]ermined and may still determine
       a value at some point in the future.}
    {- [`Det v], if the future [`Det]ermined the value [v].}
    {- [`Never], if the future will never determine a value.}}

    If the state of a future [f] is [`Det] or [`Never] we say that
    the future is {e set}.
    
    The module {!Fut.Ops} defines a few infix operators to make the code more 
    readable. For example the {!Ops.(>>=)} operator can be used for
    {!bind}. This makes it easier to sequence binds:
{[
open Fut.Ops;;

let time_to_revolt d = Fut.tick d in
let revolt =
  time_to_revolt 1.871              >>= fun () ->
  Fut.apply Printf.printf "Revolt!" >>= fun () -> 
  time_to_revolt 0.72               >>= fun () -> 
  Fut.apply Printf.printf "Again!"

let () = ignore (Fut.await revolt)
]}

    {2:semantics Semantics}
  
    The semantic function \[\][: 'a Fut.t -> time -> 'a Fut.state]
    gives meaning to a future [f] by mapping it to a function
    \[[f]\] that give its {{!type:state}state} at any point in time 
    (after its creation). We write \[[f]\]{_t} the evaluation of 
    this {e semantic} function at time [t]. 

    Remember that once a future is set it never changes again.
    This is captured by the following axiom that holds for any future
    [f] at any time [t]:
    {ul 
    {- If \[[f]\]{_t} [<> `Undet] then for all [t' > t] we have 
       \[[f]\]{_t'} = \[[f]\]{_t}}}
    The semantics of combinators are given in terms of \[\] by describing
    only the instants at which the resulting future is set. In the remaining 
    undescribed instants the state of the future is implicitly taken to be 
    unset, i.e. [`Undet]etermined. The descriptions also implicitly 
    quantify universally over the free variable [t]. 
   
    {2:neverdet Never determined futures} 

    [Fut] makes a distinction between a future that is undetermined
    and {e may} remain so forever and a future that is {e known} to be
    never determined (e.g. {!Fut.never}), a future with state
    [`Never]. Futures depending on a future value that [`Never]
    determines also never determine. This means that most combinator
    whenever they are given a future that never determines return a
    future that never determines.

    One way to get never determined futures is by using the future
    exclusive choice combinator {!first} between two futures. The
    first one that determines makes the other become never
    determined. Note that for future created with {!Fut.apply}, the
    application (and its effects) may (or not) still be executed, but
    it's value is discarded.

    {2:exceptions Exceptions}

    If the computation to determine a future's value raises an
    exception it is set to [`Never] determine and the exception is
    logged by the runtime system to the handler provided by
    {!Runtime.set_exn_trap}. The default handler is backend dependent
    but usually logs the exception on [stderr].

    There is a single exception to this behaviour. If the exception {!Never} 
    is raised by an application given to {!Fut.apply}, the corresponding
    future never determines but the exception is not logged.

    Do not rely on the fact that exceptions are automatically trapped
    by the system, this mechanism is in place so that {e unexpected}
    exceptions do not kill the runtime system for long running
    programs. If you deal with a library that is designed around
    exceptions you should catch and handle them, if only to use
    {!Fut.never} if you wish so. For example if looking up a data
    structure may return [Not_found] don't do that:
{[
let find k m = Fut.ret (M.find k m)
]}
    This may significantly obfuscate what's happening (and won't be 
    efficient). Explicitely handle the exception:
{[
let find k m = try Fut.ret (M.find k m) with Not_found -> Fut.never () 
]} 
In this example, using option types may anway be clearer: 
{[
let find k m = Fut.ret (try Some (M.find k m) with Not_found -> None) 
]}

    {2:futqueues Future queues}

    Future queues determine long-running or blocking function
    applications with a set of concurrent workers usually implemented
    as system threads. 

    A future queue determines the applications submitted to it through
    the {!Fut.apply} function {e sequentially} and in FIFO order. This
    property also makes them a mutual exclusion synchronization
    primitive. Applications submitted in two different queues are
    determined concurrently. In the following examples [f1] and [f2]
    will be set sequentially, while [f3] will do so concurrently to
    those.
{[
let q1 = Fut.Queue.create ()
let q2 = Fut.Queue.create ()
let f1 = Fut.apply ~queue:q1 Printf.printf "first f1"
let f2 = Fut.apply ~queue:q1 Printf.printf "then f2" 
let f3 = Fut.apply ~queue:q2 Printf.printf "f3 at anytime"
]}
    Note that the function applications are executed on another 
    threads and as such must respect Fut's {{!futandthreads}thread safety 
    rule}.

    There is a special queue the {{!Queue.concurrent}concurrent} queue
    which is the default argument of {!apply}. This queue has no FIFO
    ordering constraint: anything submitted to it is determined
    concurrently. It is useful to just apply a long-running function 
    to avoid starving the runtime system:
{[
let long_work = Fut.apply long_running_function ()
]}
    It is also possible to provide a reference cell [abort] to {!apply}. 
    This reference cell will be set [true] by the runtime system 
    if the future is aborted by the runtime system. This can be used to 
    stop the application. For example:
{[
let long_running_work abort = 
  while (not !abort || !finished) do ... done 

let abort = ref false 
let long_work = Fut.apply ~abort long_running_work abort
let _ = Fut.abort long_work (* will set abort to [true] *)
]}
   Note that the runtime system never reads abort it just sets it to 
   [true] when appropriate.


    {2:promises Promises}

    Promises are used to expose the functionality of third-party
    libraries as futures. A call to {!promise} returns a promise that
    has an associated future (returned by {!future}). The promise
    can be {!set}, which sets the associated future. See
    {{!promiseex}this example} to see how promises can be used to
    expose callback based asynchronous interfaces as futures.

    Note that {!Fut.set} must be called on [Fut]'s thread. If one
    needs to set futures from another thread, a {!Runtime.action}
    can be used. See the next section.
    
    {2:futandthreads Fut and system threads}
    
    Except for applications determined on {{!queues}future queues},
    [Fut] has a single-threaded cooperative concurency model. This
    means that at any time there's only one future that is trying to
    determine its value on [Fut]'s thread.
    
    {b Thread-safety rule.} The thread-safety rule of [Fut] is simple.
    A single thread must run [Fut]'s runtime system via a call to
    {!await} and {b no other} thread is allowed to use {b any} function of
    [Fut] except, {!promise}, {!future}, {!state} and
    {!Runtime.action}.

    In particular the thread-safety rule {b does apply} to function
    applications performed with {!Fut.app} as they are performed on
    other threads.

    [Fut] tries to abstract away all your thread needs via the concept
    of {{!queues}future queues}.  Sometimes this is however infeasible
    for example because a library prevents you from sharing structures
    across threads and future queues provides you no support to
    control on which thread an application will happen. In that case
    you can still create your own system thread and interact with
    [Fut] by using {!promise} and a {!Runtime.action} to {!Fut.set} it
    once it determined. See {{!threadex}this example}.

    Before any call to {!apply} or {!Runtime.set_thread_count} the 
    program is single threaded.

    {2:futandprocesses Fut and system processes}

    In general [Unix.fork] does not cope well with threads. The best
    approach is thus to fork all the processes you need before the
    first call to {!await}.

    {2:promiseex Integration with asynchronous functions}
    
    Suppose we have a function to perform asynchronous reads on a regular
    file whose signature is as follows:
{[
type read = [ `Error | `Read of int ]
val Aio.read : Unix.file_descr -> string -> int -> int -> (read -> unit) -> unit
]} 
    where [read fd s j l k] tries to read [l] bytes from [fd] to 
    store them in [s] starting at [j] calling [k] when it has 
    completed. 

    Exposing this function call as a future is very simple. Create
    a promise and set it in the callback [k]:
{[
val read : Unix.file_descr -> string -> int -> int -> read Fut.t
let read fd s j l = 
  let p = Fut.promise () in 
  let k r = Fut.set p (`Det r) in 
  Aio.read fd s j l k;
  Fut.future p
]}
    It is however important to make sure that the thread that
    calls the continuation [k] is [Fut]'s thread. If this is
    not the case the callback [k] can be replaced by:
{[
let k r = Fut.Runtime.action (fun () -> Fut.set p (`Det r))
]}
    {2:threadex Integration with threads}

    If for some reason you cannot use {{!queues}future queues} and
    need to run a service in its own thread, the code below shows how
    to interact with [Fut] and respect its {{!futandthreads}thread-safety}
    rule.
{[
module Service : sig
  type request 
  type response 
  val request : request -> response Fut.t
  val run : unit -> unit
end = struct
  type request 
  type response

  let m = Mutex.create ()
  let not_empty = Condition.create () 
  let requests = Queue.create ()

  let request req = (* executed by [Fut]'s thread. *)
    let abort' = ref false in 
    let abort () = abort' := true in
    let promise = Fut.promise ~abort () in
    Mutex.lock m; 
    Queue.add (req, promise, abort') requests;
    Condition.signal not_empty;
    Mutex.unlock m;
    Fut.future promise
      
  let rec serve () = (* executed by the service's thread. *)
    Mutex.lock m;
    while Queue.is_empty requests do Condition.wait not_empty m done;
    let (req, promise, abort) = Queue.pop requests in
    Mutex.unlock m; 
    let resp = do_service req abort in 
    let set () = Fut.set promise (`Det resp) in
    if not !abort then Fut.Runtime.action set;
    serve ()
    
    let run () = ignore (Thread.create serve ())
end
