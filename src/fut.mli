(** Future values for asynchronous programming.

    [Fut] provides support to define and combine futures.  A future is
    an undetermined value that becomes determined at an arbitrary
    point in the future. The future acts as a place-holder for the
    value while it is undetermined. 

    {{!promises}Promises} determine the value of futures cooperatively
    while {{!queues}future queues} determine the value of blocking or
    long running function applications with a set of system threads
    and act as a mutual exclusion synchronization primitive.

    The {!Fut.Unix} module wraps [Unix] non-blocking calls as futures,
    abstracting away the underlying IO multiplexing mechanism. It also
    provides functions to handle [Unix] blocking calls and their errors.

    Consult the {{!basics}basics}, the {{!semantics}semantics} 
    and {{!examples}examples}.

    affected and set to never determine. It doesn't affect the
    determination of futures it may be waiting on. Also, aborting an a
    future that is set has no effect since once the future is set it
    never changes again.

    a future queue, there's no guarantee that the corresponding application
    will be/has not been executed when it is set to [`Never]. In any
    case the semantics of futures is preserved, it will switch from [`Undet]

    Any uncaught exception of [fn v] also sets the future to never determine

    {b Note.} If your program is not multi-threaded yet, it will

    seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. If [d] and [abs] denote 
    an earlier time the future determines immediately.

    {b TODO.} not sure the [abs] argument is a good idea, let's leave
    POSIX time out of the equation. Ideally backends should implement
    these functions using a monotonic clock and not POSIX time.

(** {1:basics Basics} 
    
    A future is a place-holder for a value that may become determined
    at an arbitrary point in the future. Futures can be combined
    together to define new futures that will determine whenever the
    underlying futures do. For example, below [revolt] determines once
    [time_to_revolt] does.
{[
let time_to_revolt = Fut.tick 1.871 in
let revolt = Fut.bind time_to_revolt 
  (fun `Tick -> Fut.apply Printf.printf "Revolt!")

let () = ignore (Fut.await revolt)   
]}
    A future can be in three different states described by the type 
    {!type:state} and returned by the (non-blocking) function {!Fut.state}. 
    It is:
    {ul 
    {- [`Undet], if the future is [`Undet]ermined and may still determine
       a value at some point in the future.}
    {- [`Det v], if the future [`Det]ermined the value [v].}
    {- [`Never], if the future will never determine a value.}}

    If the state of a future [f] is [`Det] or [`Never] we say that
    the future is {e set}.

    TODO note non-blocking.
    
    The module {!Fut.Ops} defines a few infix operators to make the code more 
    readable. For example the {!Ops.(>>=)} operator can be used for
    {!bind}. This makes it easier to sequence binds:
{[
open Fut.Ops;;

let time_to_revolt d = Fut.tick d in
let revolt =
  time_to_revolt 1.871 >>= fun `Tick ->
  Fut.apply Printf.printf "Revolt!" >>= fun () -> 
  time_to_revolt 0.72 >>= fun `Tick -> 
  Fut.apply Printf.printf "Again!"

let () = ignore (Fut.sync revolt)
]}

    {2:semantics Semantics}
  
    The semantic function \[\][: 'a Fut.t -> time -> 'a Fut.state]
    gives meaning to a future [f] by mapping it to a function
    \[[f]\] that give its {{!type:state}state} at any point in time 
    (after its creation). We write \[[f]\]{_t} the evaluation of 
    this {e semantic} function at time [t]. 

    Remember that once a future is set it never changes again.
    This is captured by the following axiom that holds for any future
    [f] at any time [t]:
    {ul 
    {- If \[[f]\]{_t} [<> `Undet] then for all [t' > t] we have 
       \[[f]\]{_t'} = \[[f]\]{_t}}}
    The semantics of combinators are given in terms of \[\] by describing
    only the instants at which the resulting future is set. In the remaining 
    undescribed instants the state of the future is implicitly taken to be 
    unset, i.e. [`Undet]etermined. The descriptions also implicitly 
    quantify universally over the free variable [t]. 
   
    {2:neverdet Never determined futures} 

    [Fut] makes a distinction between a future that is undetermined
    and {e may} remain so forever and a future that is {e known} to be
    never determined (e.g. {!Fut.never}), a future with state
    [`Never]. Futures depending on a future value that [`Never]
    determines also never determine. This means that most combinator
    whenever they are given a future that never determines return a
    future that never determines.

    One way to get never determined futures is by using the future
    exclusive choice combinator {!first} between two futures. The
    first one that determines makes the other become never
    determined. Note that for future created with {!Fut.apply}, the
    application (and its effects) may (or not) still be executed, but
    it's value is discarded.

    {2:exceptions Exceptions}

    If the computation to determine a future's value raises an
    exception it is set to [`Never] determine and the exception is
    logged by the runtime system to the handler provided by
    {!Runtime.set_exn_trap} (default does nothing). An exception to
    this behaviour is the {!Never} exception which makes a future
    never determine without having the exception logged.

    
    It should be considered bad style to rely on the fact that
    exceptions are automatically trapped by the system. This mechanism
    is in place so that {e unexpected} exceptions do not kill the
    runtime system for long running programs. If you deal with a
    library that is designed around exceptions you should catch and
    handle them, if only to use {!Fut.never} if you wish so. For example
    if looking up a data structure does return [Not_found] don't do that:
{[
let find k m = Fut.ret (M.find k m)
]}
    This may significantly obfuscate what's happening. Explicitely handle
    the exception:
{[
let find k m = try Fut.ret (M.find k m) with Not_found -> Fut.never () 
]} 
in this example using option types may anway be clearer: 
{[
let find k m = Fut.ret (try Some (M.find k m) with Not_found -> None) 
]}

    TODO default trap logs to stderr.

    {2:futqueues Future queues}

    Future queues determine long-running or blocking function
    applications with a set of system worker threads. The FIFO
    application order of future queues also makes them a mutual
    exclusion synchronization primitive. 

    TODO, no [Fut] calls in applied function. 

    {2:promises Promises}

    Promises are used to expose the functionality of third-party
    libraries as futures. A call to {!promise} returns a promise that
    has an associated future (returned by {!future}). The promise
    can be {!set}, which sets the associated future. See
    {{!promiseex}this example} to see how promises can be used to
    expose callback based asynchronous interfaces as futures.

    Note that {!Fut.set} must be called on [Fut]'s thread. If one
    needs to set futures from another thread, a {!Runtime.action}
    can be used. See the next section.
    
    {2:futandthreads Fut and system threads}
    
    Except for applications determined on {{!queues}future queues},
    [Fut] has a single-threaded cooperative concurency model. This
    means that at any time there's only one future that is trying to
    determine its value on [Fut]'s thread.
    
    {b Thread-safety rule.} The thread-safety rule of [Fut] is simple.
    A single thread must run [Fut]'s runtime system via a call to
    {!await} and {b no other} thread is allowed to use {b any} function of
    [Fut] except, {!promise}, {!future}, {!state} and
    {!Runtime.action}.

    In particular the thread-safety rule {b does apply} to function
    applications performed with {!Fut.app} as they are performed on
    other threads.

    [Fut] tries to abstract away all your thread needs via the concept
    of {{!queues}future queues}.  Sometimes this is however infeasible
    for example because a library prevents you from sharing structures
    across threads and future queues provides you no support to
    control on which thread an application will happen. In that case
    you can still create your own system thread and interact with
    [Fut] by using {!promise} and a {!Runtime.action} to {!Fut.set} it
    once it determined. See {{!threadex}this example}.

    Before any call to {!apply} or {!Runtime.set_thread_count} the 
    program is single threaded.

    {2:futandprocesses Fut and system processes}

    In general [Unix.fork] does not cope well with threads. The best
    approach is thus to fork all the processes you need before the
    first call to {!await}. If you plan to use future queues TODO

    {2:promiseex Integration with asynchronous functions}
    
    Suppose we have a function to perform asynchronous reads on a regular
    file whose signature is as follows:
{[
type read = [ `Error | `Read of int ]
val Aio.read : Unix.file_descr -> string -> int -> int -> (read -> unit) -> unit
]} 
    where [read fd s j l k] tries to read [l] bytes from [fd] to 
    store them in [s] starting at [j] calling [k] when it has 
    completed. 

    Exposing this function call as a future is very simple. Create
    a promise and set it in the callback [k]:
{[
val read : Unix.file_descr -> string -> int -> int -> read Fut.t
let read fd s j l = 
  let p = Fut.promise () in 
  let k r = Fut.set p (`Det r) in 
  Aio.read fd s j l k;
  Fut.future p
]}
    It is however important to make sure that the thread that
    calls the continuation [k] is [Fut]'s thread. If this is
    not the case the callback [k] can be replaced by:
{[
let k r = Fut.Runtime.action (fun () -> Fut.set p (`Det r))
]}
    {2:threadex Integration with threads}

    If for some reason you cannot use {{!queues}future queues} and
    need to run a service in its own thread, the code below shows how
    to interact with [Fut] and respect its {{!futandthreads}thread-safety}
    rule.
{[
module Service : sig
  type request 
  type response 
  val request : request -> response Fut.t
  val run : unit -> unit
end = struct
  type request 
  type response

  let m = Mutex.create ()
  let not_empty = Condition.create () 
  let requests = Queue.create ()

  let request req = (* executed by [Fut]'s thread. *)
    let abort' = ref false in 
    let abort () = abort' := true in
    let promise = Fut.promise ~abort () in
    Mutex.lock m; 
    Queue.add (req, promise, abort') requests;
    Condition.signal not_empty;
    Mutex.unlock m;
    Fut.future promise
      
  let rec serve () = (* executed by the service's thread. *)
    Mutex.lock m;
    while Queue.is_empty requests do Condition.wait not_empty m done;
    let (req, promise, abort) = Queue.pop requests in
    Mutex.unlock m; 
    let resp = do_service req abort in 
    let set () = Fut.set promise (`Det resp) in
    if not !abort then Fut.Runtime.action set;
    serve ()
    
    let run () = ignore (Thread.create serve ())
end
]}  

    {2:multip Integration with multiprocessing}
    
    You may want to use futures to delegate work to other processes.

    {2:signals Integration with signals} 

    {2:backend Other backends}

    For now [Fut] supports only a backend based on [select(2)]. New
    backends may be written and added with {!Runtime.set_backend}. 
    Note that changing backend while values are determined in 
    future queues is unsupported.
